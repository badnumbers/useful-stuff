These tips from Patrick Dupuis:
1. Ensure realtime scheduling is enabled. http://jackaudio.org/faq/linux_rt_config.html
2. 'ok, you should increase the priority level to 80-ish' - in qjackctl advanced settings
3. tweaking the frames/period in the settings will also help (don't go to low)
4. also set your CPU to use the performance governor - you might have to install a package from the ubuntu repos in order to do that

CPU governor
1. sudo apt-get install cpufrequtils
2. cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor
- Tells you which governor is currently being used
3. cpufreq-info | grep 'current CPU fr'
- Gives you the current CPU frequency
4. cpufreq-set -g performance
- Sets the governor to performance
5. cpufreq-set -g powersave
- Sets it back to powersave
