Install supercollider itself :)
Install kazam: package is called kazam in Ubuntu
Install PulseAudio Sink and Sources - package is called pulseaudio-module-jack in Ubuntu

Once, that's all done, here's the setup you need to start making your screencast:

Plug the Scarlett 2i2 into the laptop
Plug the headphones into the output jack of the Scarlett 2i2

In qjackctl:
In Setup:
Jack: Go to Interface and choose 'hw:USB the Scarlett 2i2 USB (hw:2)' from the list of options
Now start Jack.

Start supercollider and boot the server

Back in qjackctl:
in Connect:
Map the Supercollider outs to Jack Source ins
DO NOT disconnect the Supercollider outs from the system outs

In the Sound program in Linux Mint:
Output: Analogue Output Scarlett 2i2 USB
Input: Jack source (PulseAudio JACK Source)

In Kazam:
Preferences / General / Microphone: choose 'Jack source (PulseAudio JACK Source)'
