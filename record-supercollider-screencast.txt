Install supercollider itself :)
Install kazam: package is called kazam in Ubuntu
Install PulseAudio Sink and Sources - package is called pulseaudio-module-jack in Ubuntu

Once, that's all done, here's the setup you need to start making your screencast:

Plug the headphones into the output jack of the Scarlett 2i2

In qjackctl, in Connect:
Map the Supercollider outs to Jack Source ins
And in Setup
Jack: Go to Interface and choose 'hw:USB the Scarlett 2i2 USB (hw:2)' from the list of options
Now start Jack.

In the Sound program in Linux Mint:
Input: Jack source (PulseAudio JACK Source)
Output: Analogue Output Scarlett 2i2 USB

In Kazam:
Preferences / General / Microphone: choose 'Jack source (PulseAudio JACK Source)'
