 Covers getting device names and listing the partitions in each drive, as well as formatting as FAT32 and using dd to create a bootable USB drive.
 
 sudo su -> get permanent superuser session
 fdisk -l -> get list of devices and their partitions
 umount /dev/sdb* -> unmount any device starting with /dev/sdb (gets the USB drive on this system)
 fdisk /dev/sdb -> start start 'session' to monkey around with partitions
 choose d to delete a partition
 a to change the bootability of a partition
 n (I think) to create a new one
 m to get the list of options
 Use w to write your choice - not committed until then
